		<h1>About Me:</h1>

		<p>
			Hi there! My name is Loren Velasquez. I hold a Masters in Applied Statistics, a Bachelors in Bioinformatics and a Bachelors in Molecular Biology; all from Loyola University Chicago. </p>

		<p>
			I am fascinated by data! I am especially passionate about data for social good (civic data, health data, etc.); the data with the potnetial to bring about social good & positive changes to the community. </p>

		<p>	
			To me, being a data enthusiast is a lot like being Indiana Jones (but with less physical danger involved, haha); The Data is the Jungle & the hidden information waiting to be uncovered are ancient artifacts just waiting to found! </p>

		<p>	
			I am an active member of Statistics Without Borders (SWB) and I am really able to exercise my interest for working with data as a pro bono data/statistical consultant.  </p>
